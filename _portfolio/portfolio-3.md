Developed a round-robin simulator capable of processing a list of tasks, each with its anticipated runtime, and generating output for each process, including average wait time and total execution time. Designed a thread-safe hashmap and optimized its performance by adjusting mutex lock granularity, hash-table size, and the number of concurrent threads.
