This was a talk where we introduce and motivate $$\epsilon-\text{DP}$$ and we talk about methods such as the laplacian mechanism, the curator model. Wtih left over time, we introduce online learning, and how perceptron is an online learning algorithm in disguise. We also brefily talk about the Multiplicative Weights Method and no-regret algorithms to show a proof for why boosting works in machine learning.
