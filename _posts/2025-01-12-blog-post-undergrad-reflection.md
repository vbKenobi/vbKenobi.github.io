I’m happy to say that my ego has grown to the point where I feel ready to write about everything I’ve learned over the past four years in college. Hopefully, this post can help someone out there. Choosing a title for this post was a bit of a debate. Some of the options I considered included: Reflections on College, College Advice, Surviving College, How to Graduate from UCLA, and Graduating with a Computer Science Degree: Takeaways. Honestly, any of these could work, but they all miss something essential.

Yes, I did graduate with a CS degree, but much of what I’ll talk about here has little to do with computer science. It would even be a stretch to say I’m an expert in the field. Sure, I’ve graduated, and I have a broad understanding of many topics in CS, but to claim I possess deep insights into the entire field at this stage would be laughable. That’s a topic for another post (insert link here).

Titles like College Reflections also fail to capture one important truth: no one else will have the same experience I did. In fact, very few people will even have a similar one. With all that said, let me clarify my intent:

This is a highly opinionated blog post reflecting on my college experience. *Take the advice, ignore it, tell me it’s wrong—whatever works for you. Everything I write from here on out is **unapologetically my perspective***.

I think the best way to organize this is going through each of my 4 years, and in each year I try to motivate a new idea I learned. 

### Freshman Year: Balance  
Freshman year—ah, the joy of innocence. Just you wait. No, I’m kidding. Well, not really. Coming into my freshman year, I saw college as a brand-new start—a chance to shed my shy, closed-off personality and learn how to be more social and friendly (without embellishments: how to be more “popular”). Quick note: I am far from popular.  

With this new mindset, I spent my first quarter at UCLA organizing large 13-person dinners, texting people to join, and coordinating hangouts. It was a blast, but also a lot of work, leaving me with little to no time outside of those efforts.  

For context, here’s a rundown of my Fall and Winter Quarter classes:  
- **CS 31**: Intro to CS  
- **Math 33B**: “Joke” Math Class  
- **Ling 1**: Random Elective  
- **CS 32**: Good CS Class  
- **Math 61**: “Eh” Math Class  
- **Physics 1B**: Why am I even doing this?  

If you’re graduating from UCLA, those names will make sense. If not, don’t worry—I’ll sum them up. In short, these classes required minimal effort from someone with the right background. So, I barely spent any time studying and continued my streak of socializing.  

No, I didn’t party, but I did grow close to a few people from those 13-person dinners. I’d stay up until 3 a.m. talking with them most nights, investing zero time in academics. On top of that, I played an absurd amount of tennis. I’m no athlete, so playing three hours a day, seven days a week, took a toll on my body. At one point, I physically couldn’t walk and had to take a week off from classes. There’s even a record of me emailing a TA to explain why I couldn’t attend discussion—it was because I literally couldn’t walk.  

To say the least, those first two quarters were a blast, and my academics didn’t suffer (miraculously). But then came Spring Quarter. For lack of better words, I got wrecked, fried, cooked, flambéed. I kept up the same schedule—socializing, playing tennis, doing everything but working—and this time, my academics took a hit. It was the first time I felt like I had genuinely messed up.  

At the time, I swore I’d work harder next quarter to ensure it wouldn’t happen again. Looking back, here’s what I’d say:  *You will be beaten by something. It’s not about achieving perfect balance, but about constantly rebalancing.* 

A lot of advice I’ve seen talks about finding this mythical balance, as if once you discover it, everything will magically fall into place. I disagree. Instead, I think it’s about being willing to adapt and rebalance continuously. Sure, you could say I lacked balance during my first two quarters, and that’s partially true, but it’s not the whole story. Things turned out fine in those quarters. It was my inability to adjust when things started to shift during Spring Quarter that caused problems.  

So, let go of the idea of achieving perfect balance. Focus on being willing to readapt.  

I learned the importance of adapting during my freshman year, but that doesn’t mean I’m good at it. To this day, if there’s one skill I’d emphasize to anyone—and one thing I’m always striving to improve—it’s *being willing and able to adapt and rebalance is the most important thing you can do.*

### Sophomore Year: Sleep and Health
Okay, so the title of what I got out of my sophomore year should be fairly obvious. Coming out of freshman year, my focus shifted dramatically. After what I thought was a major * * * * -up during my spring quarter, my priorities became singular: *academics, internships, and research*.  

With both regret and satisfaction, I can say that I almost exclusively focused on these things. I spent very little time with friends—at one point, I probably had only two close friends total. I dedicated countless hours to applying for internships, pouring over classwork, and working in the lab or seeking new research opportunities.  

That said, sophomore year was also when I found my genuine interest in computer science. I took a theoretical computer science class that I thoroughly enjoyed. I liked the class and professor so much that I ended up taking his graduate-level course in algorithmic machine learning the same year. It was a challenging but rewarding experience.  

However, all this focus came at a cost. I got very little sleep, and the sleep I did get was often poor quality because of constant stress. The graduate class I loved also became one of the biggest sources of my stress. Yes, the class was tough, but I let the pressure get to me far more than I should have.  

During this time, I also got sick—badly. I tried to push through it, but it got so bad that I started experiencing migraines. It was a wake-up call. I realized that stress was at the root of it all.  

So, what’s the solution? *“Don’t be stressed”* is easier said than done. The real key is lowering the stakes. After what I saw as a disaster of a freshman year, I convinced myself that every assignment, every test, and every task was life or death. I’m exaggerating slightly, but you get the idea. My classes became my entire life, and nothing else mattered.  

While I did perform well academically, it came at the cost of my health. That’s when I learned one of the most important lessons:  *Never sacrifice your sleep or health.*  

You can survive without these for a little while, but not for long. Priorities matter, but sleep should always come first. And here’s the surprising part: you can still achieve your goals if you prioritize rest. I’d like to think I proved that during my junior year.  

After realizing this, I made a rule: no more staying up until 3 a.m. before finals to cram. I was in bed by midnight, ideally up by 8 a.m. This meant no last-minute studying into the night. If I wasn’t prepared by midnight, everything was put away—no exceptions.  

Of course, there were a few exceptions, *but reducing those all-nighters from nearly 60 days a quarter to just 2 made a world of difference*.  

### Junior Year: Moving Forward
Now, by the time I got to my junior year, I’d like to think that my sleep schedule was pretty decent and something I prioritized. I had also reached a point where I was genuinely enjoying my CS classes. Sure, they were challenging, but I was able to put in the time to get by.  

So, what’s the big takeaway from this year? It’s all about the final pillar I think is important: *relationships*.  

As you may have guessed, during my freshman and sophomore years, I was either hyper-focused on two very close friends or consumed entirely by my classes. This created a gaping hole for me as I entered junior year. After two full years in college, I still felt like I hadn’t found a community—a group of people where I felt I truly belonged and could relate.  

Luckily for me, I had joined an AI club during my freshman year, and this became the first place where I started to rekindle old connections and forge new ones. Surprisingly, one of my now closest friends was in this club. It also helped that we ended up working on the same group project for a class. Around the same time, I reconnected with a friend I used to play tennis with and started spending time with another friend who I ended up playing an absurd amount of Mario Kart with.  

Here’s the thing: these friends—and many others I’ve met—came from completely different “communities.” We weren’t all part of one big group. Some people in college find that one cohesive group where they belong, but for me, it wasn’t like that. Instead, it was about having fun with people who shared similar interests in one area, even if we were completely different in others.  

To me, that’s the biggest lesson I took away from this time: *You will meet a lot of people, and you don’t need much common ground to start a good friendship.* Once you find even a tiny sliver of shared interest, that’s often enough to build something meaningful.  

Don’t worry if you don’t find a singular, tight-knit community. Learn to find people who are both different and similar to you so you’re never dependent on just one person or group. *People are busy; they come and go. Learn to talk to and have fun with the people you meet along the way.*  

Relationships are important, and I truly believe that having good friends makes life easier. But it’s also important to remember that sometimes you need to handle things on your own. There are countless anecdotes—both mine and from almost anyone else you ask—about relationships and friendships. Ultimately, you’ll have to figure out your own stance on how to approach these connections and what you need from them.  The best advice I can give you is this: *Don’t neglect relationships. And, like with everything, balance is key.*

### Senior Year: Reflecting  
I can’t say that I’ve learned something groundbreaking from my senior year so far. But I think that, mentally, being a senior has allowed me to enter a state of reflection (from which this page was born). It’s hard to gain perspective on things as they happen, and, quite frankly, much of these thoughts were only fully formed as I reflected on my college experience years later.  

To begin, let me throw out a few clichés. As much as I hate using them, I’ve found them to be true. The three biggest tenets of my college experience were *intellect, health, and relationships*. Focusing on these areas, in my opinion, will help you get a lot out of your college experience. Of course, focusing on such broad categories can be overwhelming, so here’s a more tangible approach: *Learn something about yourself in each of these categories.* 

Now, the most philosophical statement I’ll end with comes from a 3 a.m. conversation I had with a friend (yes, I know, breaking my sophomore year rule). Both of us were reflecting on our college experiences. I shared my story, much of which aligns with the big ideas I’ve written here, but with all the gory details—names, places, and small moments. My biggest takeaway was the importance of balance across those three categories I mentioned.  

After I finished rambling, he shared his own experiences from his first two years of college. His lesson was vastly different. It wasn’t about balance at all. He said that he entered college without a support structure and, through those early years, came to realize the importance of having and building one.  

Building a support structure has very little to do with what I’ve discussed so far, likely because I came into college with one already in place. From this perspective, I’ll say this:  
**Your college experience will (hopefully) uncover something you’re lacking and push you to resolve that specific issue.**  

I won’t try to generalize too much, but I think this mirrors how life works as a whole. Our actions and current state always carry issues. Over time, life reveals those problems, and we are forced to address them—only to move on to the next thing. But who knows? Maybe when I’m older and revisiting this blog, I’ll laugh at how naïve I was.  

### Final Thoughts  
To those of you who found no advice in what I wrote, I apologize, but I did warn you that this might be more rambling than useful insight. I’ll leave you with one final thought about surviving college:  

Some people say to focus on academics, relationships, making good friends, finding a life partner, or discovering your passion. In truth, nobody knows exactly what will happen. My advice is this: *Let things take their natural course, learn from your mistakes, make changes, and explore.* Use this time to learn as much as you can about yourself.  

When it comes to surviving college, I honestly can’t think of much that you shouldn’t do. Someone can still learn valuable life lessons even if they party more than they study. The only advice I’ll give here is simple: **Don’t do anything illegal,** and college should be a pretty insightful experience.
