## Introduction

This is the second post I'm writing about my undergraduate experience as a senior. If you haven’t seen the [first one](https://vbkenobi.github.io/posts/2012/08/blog-post-undergrad-reflect/), it’s linked here. That post mainly focuses on all the non-academic lessons I’ve learned. In this post, I’m sharing, once again, my **unsolicited opinion** on the purpose of a CS degree and the curriculum at UCLA.

## Disclaimers  

I have a bachelor's degree in computer science, but I've taught very little. I don’t have a master’s or PhD at the time of writing this. I am not a professor, just an undergraduate CS student from UCLA. Also, this post was written a bit hastily, so bear with me. With all that out of the way, let’s get started.

## The Disconnect Between Classroom and Industry  

If you’ve ever interacted with your professors, TAs, or team members during an internship, you might notice that they often seem to know so much more about whatever you’re discussing. Sure, some of this can be attributed to their specialized experience in certain areas, but here’s an observation I had during my degree: much of what I learned in the classroom had limited impact outside of it in industry.  

Now, that’s not to say there was no impact at all, but often the trends in industry are years ahead of what’s taught in an undergraduate degree. For example, in UCLA’s computer networking class, we learn about the five layers of the internet... but modern systems can have up to 11.  

This brings us to a critical question: undergraduate degrees provide a very broad overview of many topics with little depth—so what are we actually learning during all this time?

## The Value of an Undergraduate Degree  

The first thing you learn from an undergraduate degree is proof that you can show up and get things done.  

Forget the learning for a second. All of us have experienced immediately forgetting class content right after an exam. The real point is proving that you can put in the required effort for 3-4 years, maintain a semi-decent GPA, complete homework, finish projects, study for exams, and pass.  

At this point, your degree doesn’t necessarily show your technical abilities—it demonstrates that you’re the kind of person who can commit to a program and follow through. While this might sound mundane, it’s actually an important trait to showcase about yourself.  

That said, I believe about 70% of your degree is about “showing up.” The remaining portion is what I think the undergraduate degree is really about: proving that you can learn the content of a field.  

Your degree doesn’t certify that you *know* computer science; it shows that you’re *capable of learning* it. If you think you know the field exceptionally well, talk to professors in a few different domains. You’ll quickly realize that the depth of computer science is far too vast to claim mastery during an undergraduate program. Those who want to deeply understand a niche area usually go on to pursue master’s or PhD programs.  

In my opinion, the purpose of a CS degree is to provide exposure to different topics in computer science and give students foundational knowledge so they can continue learning and adapting to new developments.

## Critiquing UCLA’s Curriculum  

Now that you know where I stand, let’s critique (and praise) UCLA’s CS curriculum. I’ll primarily focus on upper-division courses since the lower-division ones are broad prerequisites and don’t delve into specific subfields.  

I was part of the catalog for 2021, which meant I had to take a Verilog class. By the time of this writing, that class is no longer required (yay!). Frankly, it shouldn’t have been mandatory in the first place. By the time most students take it, they’ve already completed a basic computer architecture course and know whether they’re interested in focusing on hardware and architecture.  

If the goal of a CS degree is exposure, here are the core areas I think every CS student should have some knowledge of:  

- **Computer Architecture**  
- **Programming Languages**  
- **Operating Systems**  
- **Computer Networking**  
- **Distributed Systems**  
- **Machine Learning**  
- **Algorithms**  
- **Intro to Theoretical Computer Science**  

The last one (TCS) is debatable, but the others reflect current industry trends. Students don’t need to be experts in these fields, but they should have a general understanding of what they’re about.  

At UCLA, computer networking, distributed systems, and machine learning aren’t required courses. It’s up to students to actively choose these classes and recognize industry patterns on their own. For highly motivated students, this might work, but for the average CS major, the curriculum should ensure they get this exposure.  

UCLA currently requires about eight upper-division courses, but only five of the ones I listed are included. The first change I’d propose is updating the list of required courses to align with emerging fields and foundational topics in CS.

## Electives and Flexibility  

Electives are where students explore adjacent fields or deepen their knowledge in a core area. While UCLA does a decent job offering required electives, I think more could be done to help students decide which ones to take.  

One possible solution (though not perfect) is to require half of the core upper-division courses to be completed by the end of sophomore year. This would reduce flexibility early on but ensure students are exposed to the basics. Then, they’d have more freedom in their last two years to build on these foundations or explore new areas.  

For me, this approach led to exploring theoretical computer science and machine learning. Another note: I gained the most knowledge from graduate courses, so opening up more graduate classes to undergraduates would be a significant improvement.

## Final Thoughts  

While I’ve proposed several changes, I want to emphasize that a good portion of UCLA’s curriculum is well-structured. Without it, I wouldn’t feel confident enough to even write this post.  

Please feel free to critique these ideas and suggest other changes—this perspective is based on my personal experience, which may not represent all students.
