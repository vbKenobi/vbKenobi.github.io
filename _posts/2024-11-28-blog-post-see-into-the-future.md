A blog post about the future

> Can I see into the future?  

Of course, you can! What’s so difficult about that? I know the next words I’ll write, and you know the next thoughts you’ll think.  

> But can I know when something bad will happen?  

Absolutely. You can know when the bad will happen, just as you can know when the good will. If it’s not clear yet: the good will occur in the *future*, and so will the bad.  

> When exactly, though?  

Ah, the future is exact, isn’t it? Or is it perhaps not exact enough for the mind that craves precision—the mind that wants to know everything, to consider every possibility?  

> Yes, I want to know the exact second, the exact moment...  

But where’s the fun in that? If you knew everything, wouldn’t life be bland? A story loses its charm when the ending is already known.  

> But certainty is bliss!  

Oh, my friend, you have it all wrong. Certainty is a curse. Being an oracle is a burden. Imagine knowing exactly what’s to come but being powerless to change it—like steering a ship straight into a storm, fully aware it will sink. True certainty drains the joy from every moment.  

> But surely certainty brings safety?  

Safety? The grandest illusion of them all. Where there’s safety, there’s no progress. You want certainty to guarantee progress, but here’s the paradox: if you are certain, you won’t progress.  

> Then how can I see into the future?  

I’ve already told you! You *can* see into the future. Think of a ship—safe in the harbor, where the waters are calm and time stands still. But that’s not what ships are built for. They’re made to brave the ever-changing waves, winds, and currents of the vast ocean. Yet, they’ll never know this until they set sail. *You my friend, are the ship, and time is our ocean; you see into the future by setting sail forth into it.*
